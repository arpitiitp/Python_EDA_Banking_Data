# Banking Data EDA Report

## 1. Installation and Setup

Before starting the exploratory data analysis (EDA), make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7+). Then, create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv env
# On Windows
env\\Scripts\\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
```

Next, launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

## 2. Data Loading and Initial Inspection

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'Banking.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Quick look at the data
df.head(), df.info(), df.describe()
```

## 3. Insights

### 3.1 Deposits and Savings Behavior
- **Observation:** High correlation between **Bank Deposits** and **Savings Accounts**.
- **Interpretation:** Customers who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow their savings balances.

### 3.2 Income, Age, and Accumulation
- **Observation:** Moderate correlations between **Age** & **Estimated Income** with balances (Superannuation, Savings, Checking).
- **Interpretation:** Reflects a financial lifecycle where older and higher-income individuals accumulate more assets.

### 3.3 Low Correlation with Properties Owned
- **Observation:** Weak correlation between property ownership and banking variables.
- **Interpretation:** Ownership depends on external factors (market conditions, location, inheritance) not captured here.

### 3.4 Business vs. Personal Banking
- **Observation:** Moderate link between **Business Lending** and **Bank Loans**, but business lending is uncorrelated with deposit metrics.
- **Interpretation:** Business products cater to a distinct customer subset, separate from personal banking behavior.

## 5. Conclusion

Through this EDA, we uncovered key patterns in customer financial behavior. Deposits strongly align with savings, while income and age are predictors of balance accumulations. Property ownership appears driven by factors beyond basic banking variables, and business lending operates in a largely separate domain from personal deposits. These insights can guide targeted product offerings, personalized marketing, and further predictive modeling.
